**Key Features:**
- **Frontend:** Angular 17 app for file upload, language selection, and payment.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (serverless Lambda) for API, job management, and payment.
- **Async Processing:** SQS for job queueing, Python/Flask Lambdas for document processing and translation (Hugging Face MBART).
- **Storage:** S3 (encrypted with AWS KMS) for files, DynamoDB for job tracking, Redis for caching and free tier limits.
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption (KMS), GDPR compliance, audit logging.
- **Payments:** Stripe integration with free tier and automated refunds.
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboards and structured logging.
